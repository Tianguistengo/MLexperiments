a simple approach to plan and manage your machine learning experiments.

With this approach, you will be able to:

    Stay on top of the most important questions and findings in your project.
    Keep track of what experiments you have completed and would like to run.
    Zoom in on the data preparations, models, and model configurations that give the best performance.

why data preparation is particularly important for reanalyzing data,

>and why you should stay focused on the question you hope to answer.

Your models are only as good as the data you feed them. 
This is the      >>> garbage in, garbage out principle
flawed data going in leads to flawed results, algorithms, and business decisions.

example self driving cars-
if such an algorithm is trained in an environment with cars driven by humans, 
how can you expect it to perform well on roads with other self-driving cars?

Beyond the autonomous driving example described, the “garbage in” side of the equation can take many forms
for example, 
incorrectly entered data, 
poorly packaged data, 
not representative data
and data collected incorrectly,
