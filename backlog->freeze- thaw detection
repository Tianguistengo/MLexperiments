datasets:

-The MCD43A3 V6 Albedo Model dataset is a daily 16-day product. 
It provides both directional hemispherical reflectance (black sky albedo) and bihemispherical reflectance (white sky albedo)
for each of the MODIS surface reflectance bands (band 1 through band 7) as well as
3 broad spectrum bands (visible, near infrared, and shortwave). 
Each 500m/pixel daily image is generated using 16 days of data, centered on the given day. 
A quality band is also provided for each of the 10 albedo bands. 

-MCD43A2.006 MODIS BRDF-Albedo Quality Daily 500m

The MCD43A2 V6 Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) 
Quality dataset is a 500 meter daily 16-day product.
It contains all the quality information for the corresponding 16-day MCD43A3 Albedo and the MCD43A4 Nadir-BRDF (NBAR) products.
The MCD43A2 contains individual band quality and observation information for the MODIS land bands 1-7,
along with the overall BRDF/Albedo quality information.
