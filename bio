AlphaFold

In his acceptance speech for the 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Christian Anfinsen famously postulated that, 
in theory, a protein’s amino acid sequence should fully determine its structure. 

This hypothesis sparked a five decade quest to be able to computationally 
predict a protein’s 3D structure 
based solely on its 1D amino acid sequence.
