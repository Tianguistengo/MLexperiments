-"EPIC’s letter is one of the biggest efforts so far in the fight to stem the use of face recognition.
Along with the EU’s consideration of a temporary ban on the technology in public, 
it’s yet another sign that attitudes toward it are becoming increasingly negative. 
The conversation is changing, too. 
Initial concerns 
focused on issues of accuracy and bias, but more recently, the debate has turned to the dangers of surveillance.

-If they are trying to locate faces, I usually point out that most successful face detectors use a combination of 
skin color detection (Exer- cise 2.8) 
and simple blob features Section 14.1.1; 
they do not rely on edge detection.

-In-variance detection (i.e. Rotated Face Detection, Large or Small Face Detection)

-Residual Network (ResNet) : As we have seen that brain regions V5 and V6 receives direct connections from V1;
in the same way the Residual Network works. 
It skips connections and /or jumps over the layers. It is done to avoid the problem of Vanishing Gradient.
