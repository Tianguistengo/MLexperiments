If a robot coud reason causally, it might be able to avoid problems it hasn't been programmed to understand

The test devised by Tenenbaum is important, 
because it provides a good way to >>measure causal understanding,
albeit in a very limited setting.

The approach requires more hand-built components than many machine learning algorithms, 
and Tenenbaum cautions that it’s brittle and won’t scale well.
But it seems to suggest that a 
mix of approaches
—along with some new ideas—
will be needed to take AI forward.
