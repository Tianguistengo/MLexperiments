- (regulatization) Lasso is great for feature selection, but when building regression models, 
Ridge regression should be your first choice.

-Logistic regression is for classficiation, not regression. 

- property DataFrame.values

    Return a Numpy representation of the DataFrame.

    Warning

    We recommend using DataFrame.to_numpy() instead.

    Only the values in the DataFrame will be returned, the axes labels will be removed.
    
    
 -the greater the AUC (aread under the curve) the better the model
  If the AUC is greater than 0.5, the model is better than random guessing. Always a good sign! 

-After computing the GridSeachCV, I not just want the best params but also the best score:
# Print the tuned parameters and score
print("Tuned Logistic Regression Parameters: {}".format(logreg_cv.best_params_)) 
print("Best score is {}".format(logreg_cv.best_score_))


-Note that RandomizedSearchCV will never outperform GridSearchCV. 
Instead, it is valuable because it saves on computation time.
