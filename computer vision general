Part of the problem is a bottleneck at the heart of traditional sensors, which capture a huge amount of visual data, 
regardless of whether or not it is useful for classifying an image. Crunching all that data slows things down.

-In Image processing, *blob detection* refers to modules that are aimed at detecting points and/or regions in the image 
that differ in properties like 
brightness or color compared to the surrounding.
... It is used to obtain regions of interest for further processing.

-Pyramid, or pyramid representation, is a type of multi-scale signal representation developed by the computer vision, 
image processing and signal processing communities, in which a signal or an image is subject to 
repeated smoothing and subsampling. 
Pyramid representation is a predecessor to scale-space representation and multiresolution analysis.
