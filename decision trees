CART cost function for classificaiton
It stops recursing once it reaches the maximum depth (defined by the max_depth hyperparameter), or if it cannot
find a split that will reduce impurity.

additional stopping conditions:
-min_samples_split
-min_samples_leaf
-min_weight_fraction
-max_leaf_nodes


-By default, the Gini impurity measure is used, but you can select the entropy impurity
measure instead by setting the criterion hyperparameter to "entropy" .
