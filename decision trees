CART cost function for classificaiton
It stops recursing once it reaches the maximum depth (defined by the max_depth hyperparameter), or if it cannot
find a split that will reduce impurity.

additional stopping conditions:
-min_samples_split         #the minimum number of samples a node must have before it can be split
-min_samples_leaf          #the minimum number of samples a leaf node must have
-min_weight_fraction_leaf  #same as min_samples_leaf but expressed as a fraction of the total number of weighted instances
-max_leaf_nodes            #maximum number of leaf nodes
-max_features              #maximum number of featuers that are evaluated for splitting at each node


-By default, the Gini impurity measure is used, but you can select the entropy impurity
measure instead by setting the criterion hyperparameter to "entropy" .
