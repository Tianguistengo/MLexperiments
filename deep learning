Deep learning is able to account for the INTERACTIONS between features
(the more nodes in the hidden layers, the more interactions we are able to capture).

An activation function (which converts a node's input into its output)
allows the model to capture non-linearities (tanh, ReLu, etc..)

ReLu
"This function takes a single number as an input, returning 0 if the input is negative, 
and the input if the input is positive.

Here are some examples:
relu(3) = 3
relu(-3) = 0

-Deep nets make internal representations of the patterns in the data
that are useful to make predictions

They partially remove the need for feature engineering and manually creative better predictive features.

Deep learning is also called representation learning.

As data moves through hidden layers, increasingly complex patterns and representations are learned.

-The loss function aggregates all of the errors into a single score.

- a SLOPE (as in the tangent line next to a weight in a chart that we use to know where the next step
of the gradient descent should go to) == a DERIVATIVE (calculus)


-Gradient Descent

Gradient == an array of slopes

After "calculating the slopes, it's time to use those slopes to improve a model.
If you add the slopes to the weights, you will move in the right direction. 

We use prediction erros to calculate slopes



-Backpropagation

Tries to deduce the slopes to update weights efficiently (going from the OUTput to the INput)
{estimate the slope OF THE LOSS FUNCTION with respect to EACH WEIGHT in the network)


Each time you generate predictions using forward propagation, 
you update the weights using backward propagation.

3 things we multiply to get the slopes associated with any weight:
   -node value feeding into that weight
   -slope of the activation function for the node being fed into (1 for any node receiving a positive value as input)
   -slope of the loss function with respect to the output node


-RECAP (forward and backwarward propagation + gradient descent
     -Start with random weights
     -Do forward propagation to get a prediction
     -Use backpropagation to estimate the slope OF THE LOSS FUNCTION with respect to EACH WEIGHT in the network
     -Multiply that slope by a learning rate, and subtract from the current weights
     -Keep doing that until you reach the flat part 


-For computational efficiency, calculate slopes on a subset of the data (or a batch, meaning, STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT)
{gradient descent uses the whole training data for calculating each slope}
for each update of the weights
and use a DIFFERENT BATCH  to calculate the next udpate.
Once all data is used, start from the beginning again.
Each time you go through the entire data is called an 'EPOCH'


- Keras
           4 steps
                      -Specify the architecture
               
               We need to load the data first because we need to know how many columns there are 
               and we need this information because the number of colums is the number of nodes in the input layer
               # Save the number of columns in predictors: n_cols
                       n_cols = numpy_matrix.shape[1]
                       
                      -Compile
                      -Fit
                      -Predict



-a DENSE layer means all the nodes in one layer connect to all the nodes in the next layer

-a SEQUANTIAL model means a layer has only connections or weights to the layer coming directly after it
(other models have more exotic structures)
