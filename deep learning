Deep learning is able to account for the INTERACTIONS between features
(the more nodes in the hidden layers, the more interactions we are able to capture).

An activation function (which converts a node's input into its output)
allows the model to capture non-linearities (tanh, ReLu, etc..)

ReLu
"This function takes a single number as an input, returning 0 if the input is negative, 
and the input if the input is positive.

Here are some examples:
relu(3) = 3
relu(-3) = 0

-Deep nets make internal representations of the patterns in the data
that are useful to make predictions

They partially remove the need for feature engineering and manually creative better predictive features.

Deep learning is also called representation learning.

As data moves through hidden layers, increasingly complex patterns and representations are learned.

-The loss function aggregates all of the errors into a single score.

- a SLOPE (as in the tangent line next to a weight in a chart that we use to know where the next step
of the gradient descent should go to) == a DERIVATIVE (calculus)


-Gradient Descent

Gradient == an array of slopes

After "calculating the slopes, it's time to use those slopes to improve a model.
If you add the slopes to the weights, you will move in the right direction. 

We use prediction erros to calculate slopes



-Backpropagation

Tries to deduce the slopes to update weights efficiently (going from the OUTput to the INput)
{estimate the slope OF THE LOSS FUNCTION with respect to EACH WEIGHT in the network)


Each time you generate predictions using forward propagation, 
you update the weights using backward propagation.

3 things we multiply to get the slopes associated with any weight:
   -node value feeding into that weight
   -slope of the activation function for the node being fed into (1 for any node receiving a positive value as input)
   -slope of the loss function with respect to the output node


-RECAP (forward and backwarward propagation + gradient descent
     -Start with random weights
     -Do forward propagation to get a prediction
     -Use backpropagation to estimate the slope OF THE LOSS FUNCTION with respect to EACH WEIGHT in the network
     -Multiply that slope by a learning rate, and subtract from the current weights
     -Keep doing that until you reach the flat part 


-For computational efficiency, calculate slopes on a subset of the data (or a batch, meaning, STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT)
{gradient descent uses the whole training data for calculating each slope}
for each update of the weights
and use a DIFFERENT BATCH  to calculate the next udpate.
Once all data is used, start from the beginning again.
Each time you go through the entire data is called an 'EPOCH'

           4 steps
                      -SPECIFY THE ARCHITECTURE
               
               We need to load the data first because we need to know how many columns there are 
               and we need this information because the number of colums is the number of nodes in the input layer
               # Save the number of columns in n_cols:
               
                       n_cols = data_matrix.shape[1]
                       
                      -COMPILE
                      
               --->Specify the optimizer
               
               ADAM is an excellent choice as yout go-to optimizer
               (ADJUSTS THE LEARNING RATE as it does gradient descent
               to ensure reasonable values throughout the weight optimization process)
               
               --->Specify the loss function
               
               mean squared error is common for regression
               
                             
                      -FIT
                      
               Apply backpropagation and gradient descent to your data to update the weights
               
               Scaling data before fitting can help the optimization process
               
               model.fit -> Remember that the first argument is the predictive features (predictors),
               and the data to be predicted (target) is the second argument.
                      
                      -PREDICT



-a DENSE layer means all the nodes in one layer connect to all the nodes in the next layer.
other layers are Dropout, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPool2D

-a SEQUENTIAL model means a layer has only connections or weights to the layer coming directly after it
(other models have more exotic structures).

 
 
 ------- CLASSIFICATION
 
 -Loss function is (most commonly) 'categorical_crossentropy' instead of MSE
 (in math is LogLoss==lower score is better).
 
 -Add         metrics= ['accuracy']      to the compile step
  for easier to understand diagnostics
  
 -Ouput layer has 2 nodes instead of 1 (one for each possible outcome),
 and uses a 'softmax' activation function.
 
 from keras.utils import    to_categorical    to get 0 and 1 



You want to SAVE,  RELOAD, and PREDICT   with your model

from keras.model import load_model

model.save('model_file.h5')  h5 is short for the model format normally used 

my_model=load_model('my_model.h5')

# Calculate predictions: predictions
predictions = model.predict(data_to_predict_with)

# Calculate predicted probability of survival: predicted_prob_true
predicted_prob_true = predictions[:,1]


-a common learning reate is 0.01

- the DYING NEURON PROBLEM
once a node starts getting negative inputs, it may continue getting only negative inputs.
It's contributing nothing to the network and the neuron is regarded as dead


-"  Vanishing Gradient Problem


The tendency for the gradients of early hidden layers of some deep neural networks to become surprisingly flat (low).
Increasingly lower gradients result in increasingly smaller changes to the weights on nodes in a deep neural network, 
leading to little or no learning. 
Models suffering from the vanishing gradient problem become difficult or impossible to train.
Long Short-Term Memory cells address this issue. (also changing your activation function)

Compare to exploding gradient problem.


-----> Model validation

neural nets are usually so large that we don't really need to do k-fold cross validation,
a single run over the database would be large enough

-Early Stopping 
(patience=  , is how many epochs can the model go without improving before we stop training)
(3 is resonable, 1 no because sometimes it keeps improving after 1 bad one)
if you have a logic for when to stop (early stopping) you can set a higher # of maximum epochs to see if it learns better
(epochs=20, in the fit step) by default, keras trains for 10 epochs

from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='categorical_crossentropy',metrics=['accuracy'])

# Define early_stopping_monitor
early_stopping_monitor = EarlyStopping(patience=2)

# Fit the model
model.fit(predictors, target, epochs=30, validation_split=0.3,callbacks=[early_stopping_monitor])


-validaton split (in the fit step) + define metrics= (in the compile step, 'accuracy' for classification)

model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='categorical_crossentropy',metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(predictors,target,validation_split=0.3)

-now that we have cool ways of measuring performance (namely VALIDATION LOSS after doing ^)
we can experiment with 
                            -different architectures
                            -more or fewer layers
                            -layers with more or fewer nodes
                            -etc.



---> Model capacity

similar to overfitting and underfitting,
model capacity is a model's ability to capture predictive patterns in your data

more model capacity (more hidden layers, mode nodes) == more overfitting

-Start with a simple network and get the validation score,
keep adding capacity as long as the score keeps improving.


-------------advanced-----------------

-Layers are used to construct deep learning models, 
TENSORS,  are used to define the --data flow-- through the model

- if the input data has 10 columns, you define an Input layer with a shape of (10,).
 The input layer allows your model to load data.

# Load layers
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

# Input layer
input_tensor = Input(shape=(1,))

# Dense layer
output_layer = Dense(1)

# Connect the dense layer to the input_tensor
output_tensor = output_layer(input_tensor)

"Output layers are simply Dense layers! 
Output layers are used to reduce the dimension of the inputs to the dimension of the outputs. 



-In the compile step, we choose an optimize and a loss function,
for keras model, MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR, is a good general-purpose error function 
which is a little bit less senstive to outliers, we can also use MSE (used in traditional linear regression).

-Before fitting,            model.summary()           to get a good overview.
It is also useful to plot the model before fitting it


-Once you've defined an input layer and an output layer, you can build a Keras model. 
The model object is how you tell Keras where the model starts and stops: where data comes in and where predictions come out.

# Input/dense/output layers
from keras.layers import Input, Dense
input_tensor = Input(shape=(1,))
output_tensor = Dense(1)(input_tensor)

# Build the model
from keras.models import Model
model = Model(input_tensor, output_tensor)


"The final step in creating a model is compiling it.
Now that you've created a model, you have to compile it before you can fit it to data. 
This finalizes your model, freezes all its settings, and prepares it to meet some data!

Loss function depends on the problem at hand.
Mean squared error is a common loss function and will optimize for predicting the mean, as is done in least squares regression.
Mean absolute error optimizes for the median and is used in quantile regression. 

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_absolute_error')

Now that you've compiled the model, take a look a the result of your hard work! 
You can do this by looking at the model summary, as well as its plot.

# Import the plotting function
from keras.utils import plot_model
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Summarize the model
model.summary()

# Plot the model
plot_model(model, to_file='model.png')

# Display the image
data = plt.imread('model.png')
plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()

# Now fit the model
model.fit(games_tourney_train['seed_diff'], 
          games_tourney_train['score_diff'],
          epochs=1,
          batch_size=128,
          validation_split=0.1,
          verbose=True)

# Load the X variable from the test data
X_test = games_tourney_test['seed_diff']

# Load the y variable from the test data
y_test = games_tourney_test['score_diff']

# Evaluate the model on the test data
print(model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=False))

<script.py> output:
    10.06973339669147        --> good

-CATEGORICAL EMBEDDINGS are an advance type of layer available only in deep learning libraries.
Useful for dealing with high cardinality categorical data, text data.

To map the interger teams IDs to a decimal rating, we will use an embedding layer

Embeddings add another dimension to your data (apart from rows and columns) so we need to flatten it
to return to a 2D       flatten_tensor = Flatten() (embed_tensor)

"The embedding layer is a lot like a dictionary, but your model learns the values for each key.

# Imports
from keras.layers import Embedding
from numpy import unique

# Count the unique number of teams
n_teams = unique(games_season['team_1']).shape[0]

# Create an embedding layer
team_lookup = Embedding(input_dim=n_teams,
                        output_dim=1,         cuz we just want 1 number to come out
                        input_length=1,       cuz it's just 1 number coming in
                        name='Team-Strength')
                        
# Imports
from keras.layers import Input, Embedding, Flatten
from keras.models import Model

# Create an input layer for the team ID
teamid_in = Input(shape=(1,))

# Lookup the input in the team strength embedding layer
strength_lookup = team_lookup(teamid_in)         ==        embedding(input layer)

# Flatten the output
strength_lookup_flat = Flatten()(strength_lookup)    ==    Flatten () (embedding layer)

# Combine the operations into a single, re-usable model
team_strength_model = Model(teamid_in, strength_lookup_flat, name='Team-Strength-Model')


" The team strength lookup has three components: an input, an embedding layer, and a flatten layer that creates the output.

If you wrap these three layers in a model with an input and output, 
you can re-use that stack of three layers at multiple places.

Note again that the weights for all three layers will be shared everywhere we use them.


- SHARED LAYERS

They allow you to define an operation, and then apply the exact same operation (with the exact same weights)
to different inputs.
