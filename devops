"Today, one of the big factors that can affect the accuracy of deployed models is if the data 
being used to generate predictions differs from data used to train the model.

For example, changing economic conditions could drive new interest rates affecting home purchasing predictions. 
------This is called concept drift,------
whereby the patterns the model uses to make predictions no longer apply. 
SageMaker Model Monitor automatically detects concept drift in deployed models and provides detailed alerts 
that help identify the source of the problem.
All models trained in SageMaker automatically emit key metrics that can be collected and viewed in SageMaker Studio.
From inside SageMaker Studio you can configure data to be collected, how to view it, and when to receive alerts.

What is a data lake?

A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. 
You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types 
of analytics—from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing,
real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

In traditional software, we explicitly plan for and express how a system should react in specific circumstances. 
This is accomplished by writing automated tests to ensure applications perform as expected.

In contrast, the power of machine learning lies in how it generalizes from historical experience 
and reacts to new unseen data without us explicitly describing each case.


Since we can’t explicitly test for all of the possible cases a machine learning system will see,
we need to continuously monitor that system to ensure it’s operating effectively.



Monitoring machine learning systems is about monitoring the quality of decision making that the system enables. T
he quality of predictions is a function of many things including:

    1. The quality of the data fed to models at inference time. 
    Monitoring an ML system isn’t just about monitoring a model; it also involves monitoring all the data sources fed to the model.
