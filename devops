"Today, one of the big factors that can affect the accuracy of deployed models is if the data 
being used to generate predictions differs from data used to train the model.

For example, changing economic conditions could drive new interest rates affecting home purchasing predictions. 
------This is called concept drift,------
whereby the patterns the model uses to make predictions no longer apply. 
SageMaker Model Monitor automatically detects concept drift in deployed models and provides detailed alerts 
that help identify the source of the problem.
All models trained in SageMaker automatically emit key metrics that can be collected and viewed in SageMaker Studio.
From inside SageMaker Studio you can configure data to be collected, how to view it, and when to receive alerts.
