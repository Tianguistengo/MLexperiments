Abstract

Double JPEG compression detection has received considerable attention in blind image forensics. 
However, only few techniques can provide automatic localization.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a double JPEG compression detection algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). 

The CNN is designed to classify histograms of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients, 
which differ between single-compressed areas (tampered areas) and double-compressed areas (untampered areas).

The localization result is obtained according to the classification results.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in double JPEG compression detection and forgery localization, 
especially when the first compression quality factor is higher than the second.
