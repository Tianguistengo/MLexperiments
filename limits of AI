Other tasks, that cannot be described as associating one vector to another, 
or that are diﬃcult enough that a person would require time to think and reﬂect in order to accomplish the task, 
remain beyond the scope of deep learning for now.

5.10 Building a Machine Learning Algorithm
Nearly all deep learning algorithms can be described as particular instances of
a fairly simple recipe: combine a speciﬁcation of a dataset, a cost function, an
optimization procedure and a model.
