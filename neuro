The VAGUS NERVE's potential for love can actually be measured by examining
--------a person's heart rate in association with his breathing rate, what's called "VAGAL TONE". -------
Having a high vagal tone is good: People who have a high "vagal tone" can regulate their biological processes 
like their glucose levels better; they have more control over their emotions, behavior, and attention; 
they are socially adept and can kindle more positive connections with others; 
and, most importantly, they are more loving. In research from her lab, Fredrickson found that people with high vagal tone
report more experiences of love in their days than those with a lower vagal tone.
