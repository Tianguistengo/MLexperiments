What would the ideal ensemble of

1. methods of detection (FIRMS, MODIS,VIIRS, wind, lightning, soil moisture, weather, athmospheric data {which one?},
COUNT THEM ALL AND BRAINSTORM-->>> MISSING ONES  <<<<----

and 2. ML models/algorithms to combine and analize them--->> make predictions,
understand patters/recognize fires faster
, etc..


ensemble methods: "suppose you ask a complex question to thousands of random people, then aggregate
their answers. In many cases you will find that this aggregated answer is better than
an expertâ€™s answer. This is called the wisdom of the crowd. Similarly, if you aggregate
the predictions of a group of predictors (such as classifiers or regressors), you will
often get better predictions than with the best individual predictor." A.G.
