1.How could we use computer vision for earth?

2.What are the things/patters that we want to detect?

3.Which problem are we solving?

4.Do we have the data for that?

5.How energy-intense are training and predictions?

6.Deep Learning or classic ml?

7.Is somebody already doing these?

8.How will we fund it? how will it be financially-self-sustainable?

9. Self-driving cars
Cities in China are experimenting with a different approach. 
Rather than training autonomous vehicles to navigate existing urban settings, 
they’re retrofitting cities to facilitate the technology.
Features include roadside sensors that pass along navigational cues, like lane changes and speed limits.

Traditional automakers are focusing on assisted driving features like Ford's Driver Assist and Mercedes’ Parking Assist.
Meanwhile, Waymo continues to work on fully autonomous vehicles, and smaller companies such as 
May Mobility and Voyage are deploying full autonomy in limited scenarios that they aim to expand over time. 
In parallel, companies such as TuSimple, Embark, and Starsky are concentrating on fully autonomous interstate trucking.
