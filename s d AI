 Creative AI Through Evolutionary Computation
Risto Miikkulainen
 
 AI is now in the real world, powering applications that have a large practical impact.
 Most of it is based on modeling, 
 i.e. machine learning of statistical models 
 that make it possible to predict what the right decision might be in future situations. 
 
 Current machine learning methods are also based on hill-climbing.
 Neural networks and deep learning follow a gradi- ent that is computed based on known examples of desired behavior.
 The gradient specifies how the neural network should be adjusted to make it perform slightly better,
