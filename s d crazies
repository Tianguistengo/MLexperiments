1. Synesthesia

By understanding how our perceptions work,
researchers can better understand how we perceive language ( y otras cosas),
what does it mean to be “conscious” (mmmm tal vez no),
and how the brain processes our senses. 
For AI researchers, understanding the link between sensation and perception 
can help researchers build more sophisticated AI models that can perform complex tasks with a lot less data.

There are more than 50 different forms of synesthesia.

It turns out that in the baby’s brain, there’s a kind of a “blur”. 
Studies suggest that the sensory areas of the baby’s brain have many >>cross-activations of neural links.
Studies also show that adults who experience synesthesia have 
>>more physical connections between sensory processing areas of the brain than others.

This additional metaphor on top of the semantics helps people with synesthesia with >memory storage and >retention (atencion en ml?). 
It also helps people with synesthesia to make >>additional associations.
Studies show that people with synesthesia often >>learn languages more quickly.

Currently, AI systems, specifically natural language processing systems are mostly concerned with semantics.
But, semantics is not all there is in learning a language. 
>>> A system that can understand METAPHORS can be very powerful 
in both >>making connections between language concepts 
as well as >>inferring additional meaning.

Studying the differences between synesthetes and non-synesthetes can reveal 
localizations and networks responsible for the dynamic interactions between higher and lower levels of the brain.

Studies of synesthesia suggests that synesthetes learn differently than non-synesthetes. 
>>They learn better in categories. 
For instance, a synesthete might describe their days as, “Blue Mondays, Yellow Tuesday, etc..”.
In categorizing their days into these broad categories, 
they can remember [atencion en ML?] details such as ballet lessons happens on Mondays, emotions associated with the ballet lesson, etc..

This way of learning can happen consciously and unconsciously.
>> Using synesthetic associations as a learning strategy is strongly associated with 
creative learners, stronger verbal cognition, and stronger visual cognition.
