There are more resonances between programming and poetry than you might think.
Computer science is an art form of words and punctuation,
thoughtfully placed and goal-oriented, even if not necessarily deployed to evoke surprise or longing. 
Laid out on a page, every program uses indentations, stanzas, and a distinctive visual hierarchy to convey meaning. 
In the best cases, a close-reader of code will be rewarded with a sense of awe 
for the way ideas have been captured in words.

Many programmers have links to poetry—Ada Lovelace, the acknowledged first programmer ever,
was Lord Byron’s daughter—but it’s a challenge to fully bridge the gap. 

The Turing Test has long been a standard for assessing artificial intelligence, but, 
in the context of making art—rather than simulating consciousness
—it may not be the most valuable, or the most interesting, metric.
One of my colleagues, Mary Flanagan, a poet, artist, and professor of digital humanities, 
thinks the notion that machine-generated poems should be expected to pass the Turing Test is boring. 
>>>“Humans are already good at producing human-sounding sonnets, so why get a computer to do that? Do something new!”

As we explore the ways in which new high-tech tools seem familiar or jarring,
we continue to discover aspects of what it means to be human, as writers and readers, creators and consumers.
Can a machine write poetry? What is poetry? The goalposts move again.

The Myth and Magic of Generating New Ideas

https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-myth-and-magic-of-generating-new-ideas

Where do ideas come from? That’s a big question. 

It’s not at all obvious how to go about thinking up some new twist on these things
—the transformation from test-taker to theorem poser and then theorem prover is >> difficult to articulate. 
My ideas have always felt contingent and magical to me. I don’t think I’m alone, at least as far as the magic goes.

Henri Poincaré, the father of chaos theory and the co-discoverer of special relativity, 
is famous for a story that appears in his 1908 book “Science and Method,”
about an insight being jarred loose while boarding a bus: 
“At the moment when I put my foot on the step, the idea came to me, 
without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it.” 

The Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton, 
who devoted many years to searching for a way to multiply numbers in higher dimensions, had a similar epiphany, in 1843, 
just as he was strolling by the Brougham Bridge, in Dublin, while on a walk with his wife.
He was so delighted that he stopped and carved the defining algebraic equation into the bridge:
i2=j2=k2=ijk=-1. One person’s graffiti is another person’s breakthrough.

These stories suggest that an initial period of concentration—conscious, directed attention
—needs to be followed by some amount of unconscious processing.
In this view of creative momentum, the key to solving a problem is to take a break from worrying (trabajar),
to move the problem to the back burner, to let the unwatched pot boil.

For me, the quest for a breakthrough often requires getting myself into literal motion;
one small step for Poincaré but a whole sequence of steps for me. 
Perhaps it is the momentary feeling of being untethered that gives the mind free rein—the space to have a good idea.
The key here isn’t fitness >> it’s just a feeling of being free,
of forgetting for a moment that we are bound by gravity and logic and convention,
of letting the magic happen.

Whereas Erdős sought hyper-focussed vigilance (con drogas), 
other eminent mathematicians have found a hazy drowsiness to be the most fertile state of mind. 

Poincaré described lying in bed in a half-dream state as the ideal condition for coming up with new ideas. 

The philosopher and mathematician René Descartes famously loved to lounge in bed in the morning and think.
It was on one such morning—as the story goes—while dreamily watching the path of a fly flitting around on the ceiling, 
that he came up with the xy plane of Cartesian coordinates.

This kind of hallucinatory visual phenomenon is one of a host of well-known phantasms. 
Despite the ultimate frustrations of my dreamed mathematics, I sometimes wonder if they did in fact help spur
my creative process in a subconscious way. 
Many of my topologist colleagues, who study the properties of geometric objects, 
seem to live in an alternative, imagined world.
It’s reassuring to remember that all sorts of intellectual—and hallucinatory—predilections 
can find a way into mathematical work.

The origin stories of big ideas, whether in math or any other field, generally highlight the eureka moments. 
Chance really does favor the prepared mind; 
when the moments of discovery came, often unexpectedly, my hours of hard work felt newly valuable.

My waking, working life, like my dream life, can sometimes feel like a series of epiphanies
that are just beyond my reach—nonsensical symbols that I can’t read and invisible objects that I can’t see. 

I strike the ball and lift the weights, knowing that 
there is something about moving my body that will help move my mind.

Scientific theory, more often than not, is born of bold assumption, 
disparate bits of unconnected evidence,
and educated leaps of faith. 
Some of the most potent beliefs among brilliant minds are based on supposition alone
-- yet that is enough to push those minds toward making the theory viable.

Eminent cultural impresario, editor, and publisher of Edge (www.edge.org), John Brockman 
asked a group of leading scientists and thinkers to answer the question: 
What do you believe to be true even though you cannot prove it?
This book brings together the very best answers from the most distinguished contributors.

Another oft-heard argument is that science requires creativity,
and that — at least so far — we have no idea how to program that into a machine. 
(Simply trying everything, like Cronin’s robo-chemist, doesn’t seem especially creative.) 

“Coming up with a theory, with reasoning, I think demands creativity,” Polsterer said. (mmmmmm)
“Every time you need creativity, you will need a human.”(mmmm)
And where does creativity come from? Polsterer suspects it is related to boredom 
— something that, he says, a machine cannot experience. 
“To be creative, you have to dislike being bored. And I don’t think a computer will ever feel bored.”
On the other hand, words like “creative” and “inspired” have often been used to describe programs 
like Deep Blue and AlphaGo. 
And the struggle to describe what goes on inside the “mind” of a machine 
is mirrored by the difficulty we have in probing our own thought processes.
