Other tasks, that cannot be described as associating one vector to another, 
or that are diﬃcult enough that a person would require time to think and reﬂect in order to accomplish the task, 
remain beyond the scope of deep learning for now.

5.10 Building a Machine Learning Algorithm
Nearly all deep learning algorithms can be described as particular instances of
a fairly simple recipe: combine 
a speciﬁcation of a dataset, 
a cost function, 
an optimization procedure 
and a model.

Computational limits of deep learning

https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/computational-limits-deep-learning

A new project led by MIT researchers argues that deep learning is reaching its computational limits, 
which they say will result in one of two outcomes: 

1. deep learning being forced towards less computationally-intensive methods of improvement, 
2. or else machine learning being pushed towards techniques that are more computationally-efficient than deep learning.

The history of intelligent machines is one of moving goalposts:
Sure, a machine can do this, but can it do that? 
The “that” is often an achievement that strikes us as strongly connected to emotion—that seems especially human.
