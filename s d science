Phosphine in Venus

However, while this news does not confirm the existence of aliens,
it is likely that if and when we do discover life elsewhere in the universe
it will be in this way: 
by analysing light passing through and interacting with 
so-called “biosignature” chemicals in the atmospheres of exoplanets.

Habiendo tantos research papers hoy en dia, la diferencia entre hacer un descubrimiento y no
cada vez depende mas en tu habiildad para escoger que leer

Obstacles 

del metodo cientifico como lo hemos concebido
pero tambien de las humanas en general 

-Too much data (papers, raw signals-unprocessed, ..
-Human bias + sensory limitations + can't cope with too much data for long hours-error prone (computational thinking book)
-Seniour scientists with a closed mind
-A smaller base of educated people in developing countries than usually found in the developed countries.
-Research priorities and funding
-In most developing countries the difficulties and cost of importing scientific equipment and spare parts 
is a principal limiting factor to scientific research
-Corruption, partiality and greediness are the main factors
-You can only go as far as your tools allow you to
-Known Unknowns and Unknown Unknowns
-Societal prioritisation of commercial applications
-Patterns hidden in data
-Some problems seem intractable, too many variables and dimensions, e.g. the molecular universe, astrophysics
-Testing millions of hyphotesis
-Cost of doing experiments (money + time + human experts)

The 7 biggest problems facing science, according to 270 scientists

"Is the point of research to make other professional academics happy, or is it to learn more about the world?"
Noah Grand, former lecturer in sociology, UCLA
Scientists often learn more from studies that fail.
But failed studies can mean career death. 
So instead, they’re incentivized to generate positive results they can publish. 
And the phrase "publish or perish" hangs over nearly every decision. 
It’s a nagging whisper, like a Jedi’s path to the dark side.
"Over time the most successful people will be those who can best exploit the system," 
Paul Smaldino, a cognitive science professor at University of California Merced, says.
the selection pressures in science have favored less-than-ideal research:
"As long as things like publication quantity, and publishing flashy results in fancy journals are incentivized,
and people who can do that are rewarded … they’ll be successful, and pass on their successful methods to others."
