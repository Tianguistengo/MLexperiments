STANDARD DEVIATION 
is a number used to tell 
how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean), or expected value. 
A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the average.
A high standard deviation means that the numbers are more spread out.


------------------->  Derivatives/Math

In mathematics, the derivative is a way to --->  show rate of change:
that is,  --->  the amount by which a function is changing at_one_given_point.

For functions that act on the real numbers, 
it is --->  the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph. 

The derivative is often written using "dy over dx" (meaning the difference in y divided by the difference in x). 

A function (black) and a tangent (red).
The derivative at the point is the slope of the tangent.




----->  Sigmoid Function 
by google glossary
(s-shaped , used by biological neurons)

A function that maps logistic or multinomial regression output (log odds) to probabilities,
returning a value between 0 and 1. 

In some neural networks, the sigmoid function acts as the >>activation function.

The sigmoid function is used for the -->  two-class logistic regression, 
whereas the softmax function is used for the -->  multiclass logistic regression

Getting to the point, the basic practical difference between Sigmoid and Softmax
is that while both give output in [0,1] range,
softmax ensures that the sum of outputs along channels (as per specified dimension) is 1 i.e., they are probabilities.
Sigmoid just makes output between 0 to 1.

CUDA (Computer Unified Device Architecture)
is NVIDIA's parallel computing architecture 
that enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the GPU.

16 bit precision

 revision of IEEE 754, published in 2008, defines a floating point format that occupies only 16 bits. 
 Known as binary16, it is primarily intended to reduce storage and memory bandwidth requirements. 
 Since it provides only "half" precision, its use for actual computation is problematic.
 
  It is intended for storage of floating-point values in applications where
  >higher precision is not essential for performing arithmetic computations.

  What is Gradient Clipping?

Gradient clipping is a technique to >>> prevent exploding gradients.
There are many ways to compute gradient clipping,
but a common one is to rescale gradients so that their norm is at most a particular value. 

With gradient clipping, pre-determined gradient threshold be introduced,
and  then gradients norms that exceed this threshold are scaled down to match the norm.  
This prevents any gradient to have norm greater than the threshold and thus the gradients are clipped. 

There is an introduced bias in the resulting values from the gradient, 
but gradient clipping can keep things stable. 

Why is this Useful?
Training recurrent neural networks can be very difficult. 
>>Two common issues with training recurrent neural networks are vanishing gradients and exploding gradients.

Checkpointing

is a technique that provides fault tolerance for computing systems. 
It basically consists of saving a snapshot of the application's state,
so that applications can restart from that point in case of failure.
