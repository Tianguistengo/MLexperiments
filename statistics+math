STANDARD DEVIATION 
is a number used to tell 
how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean), or expected value. 
A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the average.
A high standard deviation means that the numbers are more spread out.


------------------->  Derivatives/Math

In mathematics, the derivative is a way to --->  show rate of change:
that is,  --->  the amount by which a function is changing at_one_given_point.

For functions that act on the real numbers, 
it is --->  the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph. 

The derivative is often written using "dy over dx" (meaning the difference in y divided by the difference in x). 

A function (black) and a tangent (red).
The derivative at the point is the slope of the tangent.




----->  Sigmoid Function 
by google glossary
(s-shaped , used by biological neurons)

A function that maps logistic or multinomial regression output (log odds) to probabilities,
returning a value between 0 and 1. 

In some neural networks, the sigmoid function acts as the >>activation function.

The sigmoid function is used for the -->  two-class logistic regression, 
whereas the softmax function is used for the -->  multiclass logistic regression

Getting to the point, the basic practical difference between Sigmoid and Softmax
is that while both give output in [0,1] range,
softmax ensures that the sum of outputs along channels (as per specified dimension) is 1 i.e., they are probabilities.
Sigmoid just makes output between 0 to 1.

CUDA (Computer Unified Device Architecture)
is NVIDIA's parallel computing architecture 
that enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the GPU.
