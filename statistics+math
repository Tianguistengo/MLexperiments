STANDARD DEVIATION 
is a number used to tell 
how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean), or expected value. 
A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the average.
A high standard deviation means that the numbers are more spread out.


------------------->  Derivatives/Math

In mathematics, the derivative is a way to --->  show rate of change:
that is,  --->  the amount by which a function is changing at_one_given_point.

For functions that act on the real numbers, 
it is --->  the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph. 

The derivative is often written using "dy over dx" (meaning the difference in y divided by the difference in x). 

A function (black) and a tangent (red).
The derivative at the point is the slope of the tangent.
