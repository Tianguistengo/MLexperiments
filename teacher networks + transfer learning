In unsupervised learning the training data is unlabeled.
The system tries to learn without a teacher.

Some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms:

• Clustering

— k-Means
— Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
— Expectation Maximization

• Visualization and dimensionality reduction

— Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
— Kernel PCA
— Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
— t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

• Association rule learning

— Apriori
— Eclat

-Google taught this robotic dog to learn new tricks BY IMITATING A REAL ONE

Google researchers are using imitation learning to teach autonomous robots 
how to pace, spin, and move in more agile ways.

What they did: Using a data set of motion capture data recorded from various sensors attached to a dog, 
the researchers taught a quadruped robot named Laikago 
several different movements that are hard to achieve through traditional hand-coded robotic controls.
