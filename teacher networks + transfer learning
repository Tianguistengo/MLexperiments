In unsupervised learning the training data is unlabeled.
The system tries to learn without a teacher.

Some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms:

• Clustering

— k-Means
— Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
— Expectation Maximization

• Visualization and dimensionality reduction

— Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
— Kernel PCA
— Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
— t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

• Association rule learning

— Apriori
— Eclat
