In unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabeled.
The system tries to learn without a teacher.

Some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms:

• Clustering

— k-Means
— Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
— Expectation Maximization

• Visualization and dimensionality reduction

— Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
— Kernel PCA
— Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
— t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

• Association rule learning

— Apriori
— Eclat

" It is also being used to develop labels on top of the supervised models."

""2 broad categories of unsupervised:


Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules 
that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.

Clustering: A clustering problem is where one can find the inherent groupings in the data, 
such as grouping customers by purchasing behaviour.

Some of the common clustering algorithms are hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture models,
and K-means clustering. The last one is considered one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms,
wherein data is split into k distinct clusters based on distance to the centroid of a cluster. ""
