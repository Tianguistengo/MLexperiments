goals:

1. How to anticipate them  , hot spots and other methods

2. How to predict which ones will grow out of control

3. How to put them off
3.1 How to treat a very hot spot in the brink of sparking into fire.

4. Analyze how far the "preventive" strategy would allow us to go (recognize hot spots 
well before they turn into fires)

4.Â¿Build a CNN to recognize near-real time satellite data -->>>-early wildfire recognition system?

5.What other sensors/databases could feed this model?  what ensemble of sensors from dif earth factors

6. Which satellites are useful?  MODIS, VIIRS, LANCE suite

7.Analyze ensemble models in themselves

8.Automate recogniction after threshold of fire index surpassed

projects working on it:

1. terrafuse.ai
2. http://www.wildfireaware.co.uk/about/

1. The super gels to enclose fire and not let it go out. How to apply them.
aka optimze firelining and backing and other response methods.  Gels could be preventive and responsive.

2. Drones vs planes

RESEARCH ARTICLE (Open Access)
Machine learning to predict final fire size at the time of ignition

considerations:

1. "It's important to strike a balance between properties and adjust it to your problem. 
Some these are: spatial resolution, temporal resolution, spectral resolution, availability,
cost, ease of processing".

2. "The holy grail is that firefighters want to be able to get on a fire in the first few hours or even within the first hour 
so they can take action to put it out, sayd vince ambosia, a wildires remoste.sensitst scientist at NASA Ames, so its critical 
to have repeatable coverage"
