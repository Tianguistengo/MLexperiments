https://venturebeat.com/2019/09/18/researchers-use-machine-learning-to-predict-large-wildfires/

goals:

1. How to anticipate them
2. How to predict which ones will grow out of control
3. How to put them off

4.Â¿Build a CNN to recognize live satellite data ---early wildfire recognition system?

5.What other sensors/databases could feed this model?

6. Which satellites are useful?

projects working on it:

1. terrafuse.ai
2. http://www.wildfireaware.co.uk/about/
read more about:

1. The super gels to enclose fire and not let it go out. How to apply them.
2. Drones vs planes

considerations:

1. "It's important to strike a balance between properties and adjust it to your problem. 
Some these are: spatial resolution, temporal resolution, spectral resolution, availability,
cost, ease of processing"
